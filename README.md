# Simon Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. It challenges players to remember and repeat a growing sequence of colors and sounds.

## Game Description

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

## Features

- Four colored buttons that light up and play sounds
- Progressive difficulty as the game advances
- Visual and audio feedback for correct and incorrect inputs
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the game interface
- `styles.css`: Contains all the styling for the game
- `game.js`: Implements the game logic and interactions

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Press any key to start the game.
3. Watch and listen as the game highlights a button.
4. Click the button that was highlighted.
5. Remember the sequence as the game adds another step each round.
6. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
7. If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing any key.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure all files are in the same directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.
